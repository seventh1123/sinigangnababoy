    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <h4>
      Choose the souring agent. Tamarind is the most traditional souring agent
      used for sinigang na baboy. You can prepare the soup with fresh tamarind
      or use a powdered tamarind-flavored sinigang mix.[1] When using fresh
      tamarind, you'll need 10 to 15 standard pieces of fruit. When using
      powdered flavoring, you'll need 1 1/2 packages, each weighing 1.41 ounces
      (40 g). You can also use 3.5 ounces (99 g) of commercially prepared
      tamarind pulp, if you can find it. Even though tamarind is the most common
      and conventional souring agent, you could also use guava, bilimbi fruit,
      pineapple, green mango, calamansi, or wild mangosteen. Other flavors of
      powdered sinigang mix could work in equal portions, as well.

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <h4>
      Cut the pork into pieces. Rinse the pork and pat it dry with clean paper
      towels, then cut it into 2 in (5.1 cm) cubes. You can use different cuts
      of pork for this soup, but the most common are pork belly and pork ribs.
      Cuts of pork that include the bone (like spareribs) will add more flavor
      to the broth. You can also mix and match different cuts to vary the
      flavor. When using pork spareribs, cut the ribs into individual portions,
      leaving them roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) long when possible. Leave the bones
      in. If using pork belly, simply cut the pork into 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1
      cm) chunks.

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <h4>
      Slice the vegetables. Rinse the vegetables and pat them dry with clean
      paper towels. Chop each one into serving portions. Cut the onion and
      tomato into wedges or quarters. Peel the taro, and cut it into wedges or
      quarters, as well. Cut the string beans into 2 in (5.1 cm) pieces, or trim
      the ends and tie the beans into knots. Chop the peppers and separate the
      water spinach or bok choy into individual leaves. Slice the eggplant into
      1 in (2.5 cm) slices on the diagonal. Peel and slice the radish into 1‚ÅÑ2
      in (1.3 cm) rounds.

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <h4>
      Heat the oil. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil into a large
      saucepan with deep sides. Set it over medium-high heat.

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <h4>
      Brown the pork. Add the pork pieces to the hot oil. Cook, stirring
      frequently, for 4 minutes or until the majority of the pork browns on all
      sides. If the saucepan has a narrow bottom, you may need to brown the pork
      in 2 separate batches. Ideally, most of the pieces should be able to touch
      the bottom of the pan as you brown them. After the pork browns, transfer
      it from the pan to a separate dish. Set it aside and cover it with foil or
      a lid to keep it warm.

      Add the onion. Place the onion in the hot oil. Cook it, stirring
      frequently, for 2 minutes or until the layers begin to separate. As you
      cook the onion, scrape the bottom of the pan to remove any pork bits.
      Allow these bits to mix into the onion as it cooks.

      Toss the pork, fish sauce, and water into the pan. Return the pork to the
      saucepan. Add the fish sauce and 2 US quarts (1.9 L) of water. Stir them
      together in the pan to combine them. Allow the water to reach a rolling
      boil before you continue. Once the water boils, use a spoon to carefully
      skin off any scum or suds that develop on the surface of the liquid.

      soften.
